The **Shūchaku Anime** Store project is a comprehensive full-stack web application built to support the digital transformation of a regional anime merchandise retailer. Developed as part of the 1802ICT Systems Development course at Griffith University, the project aimed to transition the business from a single physical store into a scalable, competitive online platform.

This solution was built with a focus on project management, business and data analysis, security planning, and cost-effective implementation. The development lifecycle followed structured methodologies, including feasibility analysis, stakeholder engagement, functional decomposition, and Agile iteration planning.

Key subsystems included user authentication, inventory and order management, product search, review and rating modules, customer support chat, and a loyalty-based rewards system using “Shūchaku Points.” An innovative limited-edition lottery feature was also integrated, allowing customers fair access to exclusive collectibles.

From a technical perspective, the platform utilized:

Frontend: React.js and WordPress for UI/UX

Backend: Express.js, PHP (Laravel), and MySQL

Tools: Asana, Git, Adobe Creative Suite, Microsoft Teams, and Chrome DevTools

Business decisions were backed by a cost-benefit analysis, which projected an annual benefit of over $114,000, with ROI expected within two years. Operational costs were minimized through smart staffing, cloud hosting, license budgeting, and advertising optimization.

The system architecture followed a secure three-tier model, with HTTPS, TLS 1.2, SSL encryption, access controls, and digital certificates ensuring data protection. Version control and documentation were handled using Git and CVS, while deployment followed a parallel rollout strategy to reduce operational disruption.

Training programs, user documentation, and system evaluations were delivered to ensure smooth handover and stakeholder confidence.

Ultimately, the Shūchaku Anime Store project reflects a balanced intersection of **IT system design, cybersecurity, business intelligence, and marketing strategy—successfully** modernizing a traditional retail operation into a data-driven, customer-first digital enterprise.
